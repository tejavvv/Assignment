## README

This C++ application estimates the selling price of an asset and calculates the long-term capital gains tax (LTCG). It reads historical inflation and price growth data from a CSV file named `price-inflation.csv`, which should include year, price growth rate, and inflation rate columns. Users are prompted to enter the year of sale. The program assumes a fixed purchase year and initial cost. Ensure the CSV file is located in the same directory as the executable. After compiling and running the program, input the sale year when prompted to get the estimated selling price and LTCG on the console.
